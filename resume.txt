A highly efficient, hardworking and talented engineer enjoy using future-oriented solutions based on data analyticssuch as artificial intelligence AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
My master’s thesis about using neural networks to identify and classify road unevenness for predictive suspensionsystems based on LiDAR sensor signal regardless the sensor limitations is not only an evidence of knowledge indeep learning but also for willingness to learn and motivation.
